<h3>2021-08-17 [UPDATE]:</h3>
<p>This project took me way longer to acomplish than all the projects I ever did, it was really hard to get to work, but after some (actually many) bugs I finally got it to work properly, still, there is so much to do, I need to refactor the code, but I am really scared of medding with the code and it stop working. I think for now is fine because I am getting starting but later I will definetely try to improve my coding skilld by organizing my projects a bit more, I studied some good practices but is really hard to keep track of everything and still get your project to work when you're just getting start at this coding world. So yes it was hard but the whole thing was amazing, specially when something worked out of blue. These are the skills that I applied when building this project:<p>
